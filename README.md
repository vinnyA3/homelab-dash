Homelab Reverse Proxy
===

A reverse proxy for my local :house:-lab.

## Services 

* **nginx** - reverse proxy
* **photoprism** - self-hosted, AI-powered photo application

More information on individual services can be found below.

## Nginx

Nginx serves as reverse proxy in the homelab architecture.  Each individually
configured web service is associated with a doman specified in my local network's
DNS settings.

## Photoprism

I'm using Photoprism for extra images and photos that I'd rather not pollute my
cloud storage with ie. wallpapers, arbitrary screenshots, pictures of cats etc.

Checkout out Photoprism on Github: https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism
